**this is for LOGISTIC REGRESSION**

- Uses log loss functions instead of squared loss -> returns the magnitude of the loss
- Training is same for logistic regression and linear regression
- **Regularization** is more necessary than ever

The function: 
$Log \ Loss = \sum _{(x, y)\in D} - y \ log (y') - (1-y)log(1-y')$
