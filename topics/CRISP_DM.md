Step to step process of studying and working with the data:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evalutaion
6. Deployment

Understanding each step:
## I. Understanding
### A. Business Understanding
1. Determine business objectives -> What is the objective of the service for the client
2. Assess situation -> Which resources can be used
3. Data mining goals -> What would be the succes from the data mining perspective
4. **Produce project plan**
### B. Data Understanding
1. Collect the data 
2. Describe the data -> Shape, size, format...
3. Explore data -> Visualization, correlation analysis...
4. Data quality analysis

## II. Data preparation
1. Select data
2. Clean
3. Construct -> Derive new attributes from the chosen data
4. Integrate -> Association between different data
5. Format data -> Reformat of the presented data for better efficiency

## III. Modeling
1. Select modeling techniques -> Which algorithms try according to the profile of the problem
2. Generate test design -> Which will be used to test and to train the model
3. Build model
4. Assess Models -> Model's version of UFC 

## IV. Evaluation
1. Evaluate results
2. Review process
3. Determine next steps

## V. Deployment
1. Plan Deployment 
2. Plan monitoring and maintenance
3. Produce final report
4. Review Project
