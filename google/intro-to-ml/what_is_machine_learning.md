Machine Learning (ML) -> \[ Training -> Software => Model -> Predict ]
- Train a software in order to produce a model
- The model can predict based on the information it has
	- It can through it's training process

Thus: A **Model** is a mathematical relation established through data analysis made using **machine learning** to **predict** results by using said model.

Types:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Generative AI
