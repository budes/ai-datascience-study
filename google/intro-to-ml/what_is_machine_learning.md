Machine Learning (ML) -> \[ Training -> Software => Model -> Predict ]
- Train a software in order to produce a model
- The model can predict based on the information it has
	- It can through it's training process

Thus: A **Model** is a mathematical relation established through data analysis made using **machine learning** to **predict** results by using said model.

Types:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Generative AI

## Supervised learning
- Questions <-> Answers
- **Supervised** as in the way of having the correct answers given by another agent
- Types:
	- Regression
		- Predicts a numeric value
			- Prices, quantities, arbitrary values, etc
		- Uses other sources of data in order to establish those relations between values
	- Classification
		- Try to fit something in a set of classifications by using a set of characteristics
		- Probability of something being in a particular category
	- Binary classification
		- Yes or no
		- "By this set of data, is it raining today?" kind of answer

## Unsupervised learning
- There isn't a correct answer to a question that 
- Find patterns
- By using a set of data, the model needs to work it's way on finding a meaningful pattern to predict other values in the future
- **Clustering** -> Associating a group of values to a group of results
	- Example: Temperature
		- A certain temperature value can be associated with a certain weather, not necessarily meaning
	- ***Difference*** from **Classification** -> It isn't defined by you

## Reinforcement learning
- **Rewards** or **Penalties**
- Made around a task
- As it performs the task better and better -> More rewards
- Example: AWS Deepracer

## Generative AI
- Generates content from and input
- Examples: ChatGPT, Deepseek, Grok, Meta AI, ollama, phi, mistral, etc
- Text->Text, Text->Image, Image->Text, Text->Speech, Text->Code, etc
- How to make one? Imitation of a pattern
- After that, it's just extension of a pattern
